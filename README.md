##Hi â€” welcome to my site. 

Here, you'll find my personal website on GitHub, which I'll be updating with cool projects and information periodically. 

For now, you can find my first project that I completed in Columbia's Lede program, in which I looked into Barbie's most common careers and how much money she made doing them over the years. Enjoy!
